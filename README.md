Question : Why my hatmacro is not working?
Answer 1: The cheat given to you contains a file called tampermonkey.txt. Once you paste that file into tampermonkey, it will work when you enter the game.
Answer 2: The scale and layout of your computer is not 100% or the screen resolution is not 1920x1080.

Question : You say Heal is best, but does the clown hat come?
Answer 1: When you really experience such a situation, you message me directly and explain how you became a clown. Our team will solve this.

Question : I've been dying all the time since I got this script? Why?
Answer 1: Because you don't have talents. If you have talent you can destroy even the world's most powerful js cheater.

Question : Would you accept it for free?
Answer 1: No

Question : What will you want from us after your purchase?
Answer 1 : Computer hardware ID Because we don't trust you to give the cheat without whitelist. That's why we will get your computer's ID and give it to you.

Question : Can we give the cheat to someone else?
Answer 1 : Depending on the computer's hardware system, no one other than you can use it. But when you buy it with Boosted nitro, you will have the right to give a gift to one more person.<!---
